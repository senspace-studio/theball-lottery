# The Ball Winner Determination Logic

In order to ensure a fair and transparent winner selection process, the winner selection algorithm will be made publicly available. [index.ts](./index.ts) is the actual logic.

1. Calculate the $BALL of those who minted NFTs at theball.fun and Zora.co (Whatâ€™s in the Ball Official NFT Collection).
2. Create Address List 1 and sort in alphabetical order.
3. Address List 1 is shuffled using the random numbers generated by the PRNG to create Address List 2. The seed value is a string concatenation of Address List 1 and hashed using the NaCl algorithm.
4. Concatenate Address List 2 with a string and generate a hash value using the NaCl algorithm. The hash values are then added together as a Uint8Array.
5. The indexed person in Address List 2 is the winner.
6. The same logic is used to determine the second and third person, excluding the winner of Step 5.

\* The Ball's operating team's addresses were excluded.
